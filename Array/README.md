## Arrays

This folder contains C++ solutions to **array-based problems** commonly asked in
coding interviews and competitive programming.

### Concepts Covered
- Traversal and indexing
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sum
- Kadane’s Algorithm

### Focus Areas
- Optimizing brute-force solutions
- Handling edge cases (empty arrays, single element)
- Time and space complexity analysis

Each solution is written for **clarity and correctness**, with comments explaining
the approach used.
