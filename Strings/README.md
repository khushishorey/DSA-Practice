## Strings

This folder contains C++ solutions to **string manipulation problems**.

### Concepts Covered
- Character frequency counting
- Two pointers
- Substrings and subsequences
- Palindromes
- Pattern matching (basic)

### Focus Areas
- Efficient traversal of strings
- Avoiding unnecessary string copies
- Handling corner cases (empty strings, case sensitivity)

The goal of these solutions is to build a strong foundation in **string processing
and logical reasoning**.
